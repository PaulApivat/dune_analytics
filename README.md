3/11 - 3/12 Note basic queries on DeFi projects

# Getting Data

_Note_: Most of the initial phase of this project happens on Dune Analytic's platform.

An extension _could_ be in the works if it makes sense to upgrade.

However, we could go through the below phases with data from the [GlassNode API](https://docs.glassnode.com/general-info/api-key).

## Web Scraping / API

## Data Cleaning

# EDA

## Visualizations
